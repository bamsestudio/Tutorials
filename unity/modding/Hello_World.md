# Making Hello World
[Go back](https://github.com/bamsestudio/Tutorials/blob/main/unity/modding/UnityModding.md)
## Write the code
Let's add some code in the Game class that prints out Hello, world!
Todo that we need to change the `Start()`, and let it print Hello, world!
Hover the `Start()` method, and right click on the code, and press **Edit Method**. You can also use **Edit Class** but when you compile it will give an error, so dont do that.
You can now change the code.
**To print out Hello, World! We need to add.**
`Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");`
When you are finished press Compile.
Now you will need to save the file. Go to **File->Save Module** and press OK.
## Game
Run the game, and you will see that nothing happens. There is not an error. The thing is there is no output, in unity. So you will need to find the log, located at `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\LocalLow\Bamsestudio\FlagGame`. The file is called **Player.log**, `Hello, world!` should be near the top, if you dont find it you can use `Ctrl+F`.

**Congratulations you finished Making Hello World**
